# Dragon Forest
## by Rob Watts
#### Python 3.7

Text based adventure game that brings me back to my childhood of running a BBS and dialing into many and playing these types of games, specifically L.O.R.D (which I still have my paid copy on a 3.5" floppy)

I'm doing this as a project to learn Python. All ASCII art and code is by me - outside of using examples seen in tutorials, as I try not to copy pasta unless that is *the* way to do a particular bit of functionality.

### How to Play
1. Copy the folders /DFModules and /Data, files DragonForest.py and configData.ini to a local folder.
2. Run DragonForest.py from the Python3 cmdline
3. Follow prompts, explore or use in-game Help

### Goals
* Learn to use:
    * Python syntax and best practices
    * Classes, Attributes and Methods: Player/Enemy objects
    * External files: Save and Load system, inventory
    * Data structures
    * Conditionals
    * Unit Testing
