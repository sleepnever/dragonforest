    You arrive at Dragon Forest. You stare at the trees
    that have been torched by fire, next to others with wiry branches
    that reach high covered in large leaves. You hear screeches off in
    the distance and the flapping of wings.

    Thoughts of turning back fill your head, but the mystery of Dragon Forest
    brings you closer.
